    "details": {
      "field1": "Detailed error message for field1",
      "field2": "Detailed error message for field2"
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Error Codes

Here are some common error codes you might encounter when working with psychoroid.com:

## Handling Errors in Your Code

When making requests to the psychoroid.com API, check the response status code and handle errors accordingly. Here's an example of handling errors in JavaScript:

```javascript
try {
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.psychoroid.com/v1/payments', {
    // Payment request payload
  });

  if (response.status === 200) {
    // Payment successful
  } else {
    // Payment failed
    const error = response.data.error;
    console.error(`Payment failed with code: ${error.code}`);
    console.error(`Error message: ${error.message}`);
    // Handle the error based on the error code
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Request failed:', error);
  // Handle network or other errors
}
```

## Best Practices

- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to your customers
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring purposes
- Retry failed requests with exponential backoff to handle transient issues
- Use idempotency keys to avoid duplicate transactions in case of retries
- Keep your integration code up-to-date with the latest psychoroid.com API version and error codes

By properly handling errors, you can ensure a smooth payment experience for your customers and quickly troubleshoot any issues that arise.
