# Error Handling

When integrating with lomi., it's essential to handle errors gracefully to provide a smooth payment experience for your customers. lomi. returns meaningful error codes and messages that you can use to troubleshoot issues and inform your customers about the status of their transactions.

## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, lomi. returns an HTTP status code in the 4xx or 5xx range, along with a JSON payload containing more details about the error. The error response format looks like this:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Error message describing the issue",
    "details": {
      "field1": "Detailed error message for field1",
      "field2": "Detailed error message for field2"
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Error Codes

Here are some common error codes you might encounter when working with lomi.:

- `authentication_error`: The API key or authentication token is invalid or missing.
- `invalid_request_error`: The request is missing required parameters or has invalid values.
- `payment_method_error`: The specified payment method is invalid or not supported.
- `transaction_declined`: The payment transaction was declined by the payment provider.
- `server_error`: An unexpected error occurred on the lomi. server.

For a complete list of error codes and their meanings, refer to the [lomi. API documentation](https://docs.lomi.africa/api-reference/errors).

## Handling Errors in Your Code

When making requests to the lomi. API, check the response status code and handle errors accordingly. Here's an example of handling errors in JavaScript:

```javascript
try {
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.lomi.africa/v1/payments', {
    // Payment request payload
  });

  if (response.status === 200) {
    // Payment successful
  } else {
    // Payment failed
    const error = response.data.error;
    console.error(`Payment failed with code: ${error.code}`);
    console.error(`Error message: ${error.message}`);
    // Handle the error based on the error code
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Request failed:', error);
  // Handle network or other errors
}
```

## Best Practices

- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to your customers
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring purposes
- Retry failed requests with exponential backoff to handle transient issues
- Use idempotency keys to avoid duplicate transactions in case of retries
- Keep your integration code up-to-date with the latest lomi. API version and error codes

By properly handling errors, you can ensure a smooth payment experience for your customers and quickly troubleshoot any issues that arise.
