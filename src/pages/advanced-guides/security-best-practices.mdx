# Security Best Practices

Security is of utmost importance when dealing with payment transactions. psychoroid.com provides a secure payment orchestration platform, but it's also crucial to follow security best practices in your own integration to protect your customers' sensitive information.

## Secure Communication

Always use HTTPS for all communication between your server and the psychoroid.com API. This ensures that all data transmitted is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping.

## Protect Your API Keys

Keep your psychoroid.com API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or publicly accessible repositories. Store them securely on your server and use environment variables to load them into your application.

Validate and sanitize all user input before sending it to the psychoroid.com API. This helps prevent injection attacks and ensures that the data sent to psychoroid.com is in the expected format.

## Use Secure Authentication Methods

When authenticating your customers, use secure methods such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens. Avoid sending sensitive information, such as passwords, in plain text.

## Implement Secure Webhook Endpoints

When configuring webhook endpoints to receive notifications from psychoroid.com, ensure that they are secure and accessible only to psychoroid.com. Validate the webhook signatures to verify the authenticity of the requests.

Implement monitoring and auditing mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents promptly. Regularly review your logs and access records to identify any suspicious activities.
