# License Management

psychoroid.com offers both an open-source solution and a hosted platform to cater to the diverse needs of our users. This section provides an overview of the licensing options available and how to manage them.

## Open Source

For users who prefer to self-host the psychoroid.com platform, we provide an open-source version of our software. There is no need for license management when using the open-source version. Simply download the source code from our GitHub repository, install it on your own infrastructure, and start using psychoroid.com without any restrictions.

While the open-source version provides a comprehensive set of features for payment orchestration, it may lack some of the advanced capabilities and support offered by our hosted platform. For a detailed comparison of the features available in each version, please refer to our [feature matrix](https://psychoroid.com/feature-matrix).

## Hosted Platform

For businesses that prefer a fully-managed solution, we offer a hosted platform on our website. The hosted platform provides additional features, dedicated support, and benefits tailored to the needs of growing businesses.

To get started with the hosted platform, simply create an account on [psychoroid.com](https://psychoroid.com/sign-up) and follow the setup instructions. Our team will be available to assist you throughout the process and provide guidance on optimizing your payment orchestration setup.

If you have any questions about the differences between the open-source and hosted versions of psychoroid.com, or if you need help deciding which option is best suited for your needs, please don't hesitate to reach out to our team at [dev@psychoroid.com](mailto:dev@psychoroid.com).
