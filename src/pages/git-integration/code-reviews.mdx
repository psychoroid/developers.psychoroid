# Code Reviews

Code reviews are an essential part of maintaining a high-quality codebase. When working on your psychoroid.com integration, make sure to:

1. **Create pull requests**: When a feature or bug fix is complete, create a pull request to merge the changes into the `develop` branch.

2. **Review code changes**: Have at least one other team member review the code changes in the pull request. Look for potential bugs, security issues, and opportunities for improvement.

3. **Discuss and address feedback**: Use the pull request comments to discuss any issues or suggestions for improvement. Make sure to address all feedback before merging the changes.

4. **Test thoroughly**: Before merging a pull request, make sure to thoroughly test the changes to ensure that they work as expected and do not introduce any new bugs.

By incorporating code reviews into your development process, you can catch potential issues early and ensure that your codebase remains maintainable and secure.
