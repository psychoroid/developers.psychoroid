# Versioning

Versioning your psychoroid.com integration is important for tracking changes and managing releases. We recommend using semantic versioning (SemVer) for your integration.

With SemVer, each version number consists of three parts: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- `MAJOR`: Increment this when you make incompatible API changes.
- `MINOR`: Increment this when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- `PATCH`: Increment this when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

When preparing a new release:

1. **Update the version number**: Increment the appropriate part of the version number based on the changes included in the release.

2. **Create a release branch**: Create a new branch from `develop` with the name `release/X.Y.Z`, where `X.Y.Z` is the new version number.

3. **Finalize the release**: Make any necessary final changes to the release branch, such as updating documentation or fixing last-minute bugs.

4. **Merge the release branch**: Once the release is ready, merge the release branch into both `main` and `develop`.

5. **Tag the release**: Create a new Git tag with the version number (e.g., `v1.2.3`) to mark the release point in your codebase.

By following a consistent versioning scheme and release process, you can make it easier to manage your integration and communicate changes to your team and users.
