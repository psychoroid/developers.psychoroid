# Branching Strategy

When working on your psychoroid.com integration, it's important to use a consistent branching strategy to manage your codebase. We recommend the following branching strategy:

- `main` (or `master`): The main branch that contains the stable, production-ready code.
- `develop`: The branch that contains the latest development changes that are ready for testing.
- `feature/*`: Branches used for developing new features. These branches should be created from the `develop` branch and merged back into `develop` when the feature is complete.
- `bugfix/*`: Branches used for fixing bugs. These branches should be created from the `develop` branch and merged back into `develop` when the bug is fixed.
- `release/*`: Branches used for preparing a new release. These branches should be created from the `develop` branch and merged into both `main` and `develop` when the release is ready.
- `hotfix/*`: Branches used for fixing critical bugs in production. These branches should be created from the `main` branch and merged into both `main` and `develop` when the hotfix is complete.

By using this branching strategy, you can ensure that your codebase remains stable and organized while allowing for parallel development of features and bug fixes.
