# Best Practices for Git Integration

When integrating psychoroid.com with your application, follow these best practices to ensure a smooth and secure development process:

1. **Use a version control system**: Always store your integration code and configuration files in a version control system like Git. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with your team, and maintain a history of your integration setup.

2. **Keep sensitive information separate**: Never store sensitive information like API keys, secrets, and credentials in version control. Instead, use environment variables or secure key management systems to handle sensitive data.

3. **Ignore generated files**: Add generated files and directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `.next`, `.env`) to your `.gitignore` file to prevent them from being committed to your repository.

4. **Commit frequently**: Make small, focused commits that cover a single logical change. This makes it easier to understand the history of your codebase and revert changes if needed.

5. **Write descriptive commit messages**: Use clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of each change. This helps other team members (and your future self) understand the history of your codebase.

By following these best practices, you can maintain a clean and organized codebase while effectively collaborating with your team.
