# Setting Up Payment Methods

After creating your merchant account, the next step is to set up the payment methods you want to offer to your customers.

1. Log in to your dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Payment Methods" section.
3. Select the payment method you want to add (e.g., MTN, Wave or Orange Mobile Money).

Repeat these steps for each payment method you want to support. psychoroid.com will handle the integration with the respective payment providers automatically.

Feel free to customize your checkout experience, set up webhooks for real-time notifications, and explore other features available in your dashboard.
