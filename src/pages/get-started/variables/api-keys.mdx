# API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate your integration with the lomi. API. It's essential to keep your API keys secure and manage them effectively.

## Creating API Keys

To create an API key:

1. Log in to your lomi. account and navigate to the "Settings" page.
2. Click on the "API Keys" tab.
3. Click the "Create API Key" button.
4. Enter a name for your API key and select the appropriate permissions.
5. Click "Create" to generate your API key.
6. Copy and save your Key!

## Using API Keys

To use your API key, include it in the `Authorization` header of your API requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

In your integration code, you can store your API key as an environment variable and reference it using the `{{ENV_VAR_NAME}}` syntax:

```javascript
const apiKey = '{{LOMI_API_KEY}}';
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

## Best Practices

- Keep your API keys secure and never share them with anyone.
- Regularly rotate your API keys to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- Use environment variables to store your API keys instead of hardcoding them in your integration code.
- Restrict the permissions of your API keys to the minimum required for your integration to function.

By following these best practices, you can ensure the security and integrity of your lomi. integration.
